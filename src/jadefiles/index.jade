						Bringing TechKobwa to life involved coordinating many organizations, including [Girls in ICT Rwanda](https://www.facebook.com/GirlsInICTRW) and [kLab](http://klab.rw/).
						The curriculum was specially designed for the camp. It included

						and a lesson from [Computer Science Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/) where the whole camp collaberated
						to make a giant pixel-art [picture](images\techkobwa_pixels.jpg) of the mascot. [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc/) kindly donated  some of their awesome kits to the camp.
						TechKobwa will be continuing next year with support from [Michigan State Univeristy](http://www.cse.msu.edu/tc4g/) and IBM.

						[Gashora Girls Academy](http://www.rwandagirlsinitiative.org/ggast/) was also looking for a student database. 
						I picked the opensource SIS [SchoolTool](www.schooltool.org) and went to work creating a program that
						would allow administers to create printable reports from exported excel data. I wrote the Gashora Grade Gadget
						using Python 2.7. It generates an html document that can be fed in to [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/) to create beautiful printable
						PDFs. For the GUI, I used the [wx.Python](http://www.wxpython.org/) library and to create an executable I used
						[pyBuilder](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyBuilder-for-Py2exe/0.3).

							The second game, TwizaDots, was made during a hack-a-thon hosted by Africa Hack Trip. 
							It's a simple mouse game for students to develop fine-tuned mouse control.
