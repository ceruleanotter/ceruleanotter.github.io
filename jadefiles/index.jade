						Bringing TechKobwa to life involved coordinating many organizations, including [Girls in ICT Rwanda](https://www.facebook.com/GirlsInICTRW) and [kLab](http://klab.rw/).
						The curriculum was specially designed for the camp. It included
						lessons on programming using MIT's [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) 
						and a lesson from [Computer Science Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/) where the whole camp collaborated
						to make a giant pixel-art [picture](images\techkobwa_pixels.jpg) of the mascot. [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc/) kindly donated  some of their awesome kits to the camp.
						TechKobwa will be continuing next year with support from [University State Univeristy](http://www.cse.msu.edu/tc4g/) and IBM.

						[Gashora Girls Academy](http://www.rwandagirlsinitiative.org/ggast/) was also looking for a student database. 
						I picked the open source SIS [SchoolTool](www.schooltool.org) and went to work creating a program that
						would allow administers to make printable reports from exported excel data. I wrote the Gashora Grade Gadget
						using Python 2.7. It generates an html document that can be fed in to [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/) to create beautiful printable
						PDFs. For the GUI, I used the [wx.Python](http://www.wxpython.org/) library and to create an executable I used
						[pyBuilder](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyBuilder-for-Py2exe/0.3).

										The most successful of which was Momenta, a 2D, touch based physics platformer. We (myself and three other students) play-tested, revised and released the finished product on the android market place.
										Other projects leading up to Momenta included a choose your own adventure style game, and a multi-player hungry hungry hippos game. We used the Android SDK in conjunction with Eclipse. For version control we used Mercurial.

							In my free time, I decided to fiddle with the action script 3 game library, [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net/) to create games. 
							In The Dark is a basic typing game. A little secondary python script was used to pull word definitions from
							the web and generate multiple choice questions to test vocabulary as well as typing speed.
	
							The second game, TwizaDots, was made during a hack-a-thon hosted by Africa Hack Trip. 
							It's a simple mouse game for students to develop fine-tuned mouse control.
